## raylib 5K Game Jam

_TODO: Add a logo lmao
![$(Game Title)](screenshots/screenshot000.png "$(Game Title)")

### Description

This repo is my submission and record of participation in the raylib communities first ever official game jam! Aside from comments in commits, also check out the planning doc I used throughout the project to get some insight into how much planning I actually do before most of the coding! Judging by how I usually do these, I anticipate the doc will be missing a LOT of content (but that's part of the fun!).

The theme for the Jam was announced to be "", and I immediately knew where I wanted to go with this. Hopefully it ended up working out half as good as I pictured it.
